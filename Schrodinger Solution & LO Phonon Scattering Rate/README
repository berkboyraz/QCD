An overview to use of the scripts (last updated @ 01.09.2022):

* The Github link for Schrodinger Solver: https://github.com/LaurentNevou/Q_SchrodingerPoisson1D_CB

* Here, the input file contains the structure from an example paper "https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.40.1074". The structure 
is defined in "input_file.m" script.

* Currently, all necessary material parameters are included. If necessary, the ternary alloy compositions can be arranged with "TernaryAlloy.m" script. 

* The solutions of Schrodinger equation (wave-functions, energies of states, ...) can be achieved by running "SchrodingerPoisson1D_CB_Kane_Main.m" 
script. The important settings are number of wave-functions (n), resolution of the grid (dz), and temperature (T). The important outputs of this script 
are wave-functions of states in quantum wells (psic), the enery values of these states(Ec), and spatial range along z-direction (z). /// The display 
settings are currently arranged only to show "psi* x psi" plot.

* The LO phonon scattering rate between first two state (T12) can be calculated by running "T12_code.m" script, based on the equations given at 
"https://erwinjr2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/physics_quantum.html?highlight=LO%20phonon#scattering-mechanism-lo-phonon"." The important inputs of 
this script are high frequency relative permittivity (eps_inf), relative static permittivity (eps_static), conduction band effective mass (m_star_l), 
wave-functions of states in quantum wells and spatial range along z-direction. The important output of this script is longitudinal phonon scattering 
rate between first and second energy states (T12). This script can be modified for other systems and to calculate other phonon scattering rates. 

* The two script can be used in a cascaded manner, i.e. saving and inputting outputs of the 1st script to 2nd script. As an alternative, "cascade_script.m" 
script can be run directly, which will use both scripts. Still, the structure definition and simulation setting should be arranged with corresponding 
scripts before using this script. This script is added for ease of use.
